Approach
Getting Website Content:

Using Requests and BeautifulSoup: We used the requests library to download the HTML content of the web pages.
Parsing HTML: We used BeautifulSoup to read and extract information from the HTML content, like the page title and description.
Finding Social Media Links:

Checking Links: We looked at all the links on the page and checked if they lead to popular social media sites.
Pattern Matching: If a link contained keywords like "facebook.com", "twitter.com", "instagram.com", or "linkedin.com", we saved it as a social media link.
Detecting Technology and Category:

Patterns and Regex: We used regular expressions (regex) to find patterns in the HTML and scripts that indicate the use of certain technologies (like WordPress or React).
Finding the Category: We looked at meta tags and the page content to determine the website’s category, such as E-commerce or Blog.
Handling Dynamic Content with Selenium:

Setting up Selenium: We used Selenium with a headless Chrome browser to load websites and get content that appears after JavaScript runs.
Language Detection: We got the language of the website (e.g., English, Spanish).
Getting Scripts: We extracted all the HTML, including dynamic content, for further analysis.
Saving Data in MySQL:

Connecting to Database: We connected to a MySQL database to save the extracted data.
Saving as JSON: We saved social media links as JSON strings to keep the data organized.
Retrieving Data:

Database Query: We retrieved data from the database to verify and display it.
Code Structure
extract_meta_info(soup): Gets the page title and description.
extract_social_media_links(soup): Finds and saves social media links.
extract_tech_stack_and_category(soup, scripts): Identifies the technologies used and the category of the website.
extract_with_selenium(url): Uses Selenium to handle dynamic content and get extra information.
save_to_mysql(data): Saves the data into the MySQL database.
main(websites): Main function to process a list of websites.
fetch_data(): Retrieves and shows data from the database.
Challenges and Solutions
Handling Dynamic Content:

Problem: Some websites use JavaScript to load content, which requests and BeautifulSoup can’t handle.
Solution: We used Selenium with a headless Chrome browser to get this dynamic content.
Complex Regex Patterns:

Problem: Finding technology and category accurately with regex can be hard due to different ways websites are built.
Solution: We created detailed regex patterns for common technologies and used fallback methods to check content for categories.
Timeouts and Load Times:

Problem: Websites with slow load times can cause delays or failures in data extraction.
Solution: We set proper timeout values and handled errors to ensure the extraction process runs smoothly.
Storing Complex Data:

Problem: Storing structured data like JSON in a relational database can be tricky.
Solution: We used JSON format to store complex fields like social media links, making data retrieval easy.
Results
The script successfully extracted and stored information from various websites. This data includes meta titles, descriptions, social media links, technologies used, website language, and categories, providing a complete overview of each site.

By using Selenium for dynamic content and regex for detecting patterns, we ensured accurate data extraction. Storing the data in MySQL allows for easy retrieval and verification.
